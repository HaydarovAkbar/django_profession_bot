Django ORM Standalone
=====================

This is a python project template that allows you to use the database components of Django without having to use the rest of Django (i.e. running a web server). :tada: A typical use case for using this template would be if you are writing a python script and you would like the database functionality provided by Django, but have no need for the request/response functionalty of a client/server web application that Django also provides. 

With this project template you can write regular python scripts and use Django's excellent ORM functionality with the database backend of your choice. This makes it convienient for Djangonauts to write database driven python applications with the familiar and well polished Django ORM. Enjoy.

:gear: Requirements
-------------------
- Last tested successfully with Python 3.9.5 and Django 4.0.6
- Create venv and pip install django to import the required modules.

:open_file_folder: File Structure
---------------------------------
```
django-orm/
├── db/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── models.py
├── main.py
├── manage.py
├── README.md
└── settings.py
```

__The main.py file is the entry point for the project, and where you start your code. You automatically get access to your models via ```from db.models import *```
Think of it like a plain old python file, but now with the addition of Django's feature-rich models.__ :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

__The db/models.py is where you configure your typical Django models.__ There is a toy user model included as a simple example. After running the migrations command in the quick setup below, a db.sqlite3 file will be generated. The settings.py file is where can swap out the sqlite3 database for another database connection, such as Postgres or AmazonRDS, if you wish. For most applications, sqlite3 will be powerful enough. But if you need to swap databases down the road, you can easily do so, which is one of the benefits of using the Django ORM. 

:rocket: Quick Setup
--------------------
Create a folder for your project on your local machine
```
mkdir myproject; cd myproject
```
Create a virtual environment and install django
```
python -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; pip install django
```
Download this project template from GitHub
```
git clone git@github.com:dancaron/Django-ORM.git; cd Django-ORM
```
Initialize the database
```
python manage.py makemigrations db; python manage.py migrate
```
Run the project
```
python main.py
```

:crystal_ball: Example
----------------------
After running Quick Start above: 

Code in db/models.py:
```
# Sample User model
class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, default='Dan')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```
Code in main.py:
```
# Seed a few users in the database
User.objects.create(name='Dan')
User.objects.create(name='Robert')

for u in User.objects.all():
    print(f'ID: {u.id} \tUsername: {u.name}')
```
Output from command: ```python main.py```
```
ID: 1	Username: Dan
ID: 2	Username: Robert
```
